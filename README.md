# AJAX / Fetch API Crash Course 

Have you ever had to decide between Fetch API and AJAX? When you are needing to get data from a remote API or PHP file, you have a few options within JavaScript. In this tutorial, I show you how to do it both ways. You can use jQuery for AJAX or vanilla JS for Fetch API.

AJAX has been tried and tested for years within jQuery and at one point was the go-to method.

This is mostly due to its ease of use and since it is built into JavaScript, you no longer need a framework or library to use it.
